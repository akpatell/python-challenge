# Aim of project 
   This project is a demonstration of my Python skillset thus far in the Data Analytics certification program.
   The following are the objectives of this assignment:
   
PyBank Assignment:
   To create a Python script that analyzes the financials of a company and calculate the following:

        ** The total number of months included in the dataset
        ** The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
        ** The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
        ** The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
        ** The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

PyPoll Assignment:
    To create a Python script that analyzes the financials of a company and calculate the following:

        ** The total number of votes cast
        ** A complete list of candidates who received votes
        ** The percentage of votes that each candidate won
        ** The total number of votes each candidate won
        ** The winner of the election based on the popular vote

# Folders for PyBank and PyPoll 
Each contains:

        ** Resources - These folders contains the "budget_data_csv" and "election_data.csv" files
        ** analysis - These foldesrs contains text files named "budget_data.txt" and "election_data.txt" files
